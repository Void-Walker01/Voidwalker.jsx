# Rohit Guleria - Personal Portfolio

A modern, animated, and fully responsive personal portfolio built from scratch with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. This project showcases my skills, journey, and projects as a full-stack developer.


## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Particle Background:** A beautiful, animated "constellation" background built with `tsparticles` that subtly reacts to mouse movement.
* **Modern "Glassmorphism" UI:** A sleek, semi-transparent header that floats above the content.
* **Dynamic Animations:** Smooth and engaging animations throughout the site, powered by Framer Motion. Includes:
    * An animated, multi-role title in the Hero section.
    * A scroll-triggered, staggered animation for the "My Journey" timeline.
* **Professional Sections:** Clean, well-designed components for the Hero, Timeline, and Contact sections.
* **Functional Contact Form:** An integrated contact form that delivers messages directly to my email using Web3Forms.
* **Fully Responsive:** A mobile-first design that looks great on all devices, from phones to desktops.
